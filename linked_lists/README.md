## Linked List

A **Linked List** is a linear data structure made up of nodes that are connected together in a chain-like structure, where each node contains two components: data and a refeo to the next node in the sequence. 

Linked lists a great for **dynamic memory allocation** and efficient insertion and deletion of nodes.

Generally, linked lists consist of two parts: head and tail.
The **head** refers to the first node on the list.
The **tail** refers to the last node, which points to 'null', signifying the end of the list.

Types of linked lists - Singly, Doubly, and Circular.


### Singly Linked Lists

A **Singly Linked List** consist of nodes with the following components:
- **Data**: The value stored in the node.
- **Next**: A reference to the next node in the list.

The operations that can be performed on a singly linked list are:
- **Append**: add a new node to the end of the list.
- **Prepend**: add a new node to the beginning of the list.
- **Insert**: add a new node after a node with a given value.
- **Delete**: remove a node with a specific value from the list.
- **Search**: check if a value exist in the list.
- **Print**: print all the elements in the list.
